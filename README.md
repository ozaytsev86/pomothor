# Pomothor
Application based on pomodoro technique to improve teams time management.

Try it https://pomothor-f46c3.web.app/

**This project is in development**  
So take into consideration some things:  

1. Once you Sign up with your Google account some of your information will be publicly visible (profile picture, first name and last name).
2. At the moment created teams are not private, any user can join any team.
3. The data will be cleaned from time to time without any communication, if you want to keep your data, please let me know.

Contributions are welcome.
